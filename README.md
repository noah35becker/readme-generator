## Description
This is a command-line program for generating README.md files. (The README that you're looking at right now was created using this program!) The program uses the terminal to guide the user through a series of prompts, generating a high-quality README file at the end of the process.

4. Rename the unzipped folder if you want, and move it wherever you'd like on your drive
5. Open the terminal, ```cd``` to the folder you just downloaded, and then run the command ```npm install``` (*you must have <b>node.js</b> installed for this to work—if you don't, [install it first](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs))
