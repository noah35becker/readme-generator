## Description
This is a command-line program for generating README.md files. (The README that you're looking at right now was created using this program!) The program uses the terminal to guide the user through a series of prompts, generating a high-quality README file at the end of the process.

2. Click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP"

4. Rename the unzipped folder if you want, and move it wherever you'd like on your drive
5. You're all set!


## Usage
Open the terminal, ```cd``` to the source folder you downloaded during [installation](#installation), and then run the command ```node index.js``` to begin. (You must have <b>node.js</b> installed for this to work—if you don't, head over to their [website](https://nodejs.org/) and install it first.) From here, everything should be pretty self-explanatory.
